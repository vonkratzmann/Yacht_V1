/** System Summary
   System consists of:
   Two 12v DC motors:
    Rudder Motor which drives the rudder
    boom Motor which tightens or loosens the boom
   A joystick connected to two 10 bit ADCS, forwards 0 to 511,backwards 512 to 1023
   On/Off switch
   12V DC battery
   Microprocessor
   Driver Printed Circuit Boards for the two DC motors
   5v DC power supply for the microprocessor
   Each motor via a sprocket drives a loop to drive the rudder or boom
   The rudder loop consists of chain and stainless steel wire
   The boom loop consists of a chain and shock cord which via a series of fixed pulleys and cables tighten or release the boom
   The travel of the loop is limited in both directions so only the chain is on the sprocket at all times
   To limit the travel of the loop, each loop has two reed switches to detect the end of the chain
   Connected to the end of the chain is a magnet to activate the reed switch

   The program reads the joystick at a preddefined rate
   then converts these readings into a Pulse width Modulated output and direction to drive the rudder and boom motors direction and speed
   On the joystick x is the rudder, y is the boom

   Uses counter 2 and interrupts to generate fast mode pwm pulses, freq is 1.960kHz
   Normal operation the diagnostic led fashes on and off every second via the ISR

   All inputs have internal pullups enabled
   so switches are 0 when pressed, and a 1 when released

   There are a number of simple diagnostics which can be enable by the #DEFINEs in Yacht.h

*/

/** Software Structure Overview
   The system consists of 8 files:
    Yacht_V1.ino:  Variable declarations, oject definitions, ISR, Setup and main loop
    Yacht_V1.h:    Diagnostic definitions, I/O and constants
    JoyStick.cpp:  Joystick class member functions
    JoyStick.h:    Joystick class decelerations
    Motor.cpp:     Motor class member functions
    Motor.h:       Motor class decelerations
    Switch.cpp:    Swtch class member functions
    Switch.h:      Switch class decelerations

    The main loop logic for the x axis is:
      check if time to flash the onboard led on or off, used to show program and isr are running
	  if time to read the joystick again, then
	    calls "check_X_Axis()" to check for a change in the x axis of the joystick current reading compared to the last read
	    if there is a change, calls "process_X()" which returns an updated speed and direction via call by reference paramaters.
	      Then with the new speed and direction,
	        checks if moving towards starboard and movement to starboard is inhibited, if yes then stops the motor
            checks if moving towards port and movement to port is inhibited, if yes then stops the motor
		    calls "rudder_Motor.set_Requested_Speed(spd)"  to set new speed
            calls "rudder_Motor.set_Requested_Dir()" to set new direction

		    Then checks if moving towards starboard and moved off the limit switch, then clear the inhibit movement flag for port,
            Then checks if moving towards port and moved off the limit switch, then clear the inhibit movement flag for starboard,

	   Repeats for the y axis.
	   Then calls:
	    "rudder_Motor.update_Speed() to update rudder motor speed from the requested speed
		"rudder_Motor.update_Dir()" to update rudder motor direction from the requested direction
		"boom_Motor.update_Speed()" to update boom motor speed from the requested speed
		"boom_Motor.update_Dir()" to update boom motor direction from the requested direction
