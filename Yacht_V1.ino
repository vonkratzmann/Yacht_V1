/** System Summary
   System consists of:
   Two 12v DC motors:
    Rudder Motor which drives the rudder
    boom Motor which tightens or loosens the boom
   A joystick connected to two 10 bit ADCS, forwards 0 to 511,backwards 512 to 1023
   On/Off switch
   12V DC battery
   Microprocessor
   Driver Printed Circuit Boards for the two DC motors
   Each motor via a sprocket drives a loop to drive the rudder or boom
   The rudder loop consists of chain and stainless steel wire
   The boom loop consists of a chain and shock cord which via a series of fixed pulleys and cables tighten or release the boom
   The travel of the loop is limited in both directions so only the chain is on the sprocket at all times
   To limit the travel of the loop, each loop has two reed switches to detect the end of the chain
   Connected to the end of the chain is a magnet to activate the reed switch

   The program reads the joystick at a preddefined rate
   then converts these readings into a Pulse width Modulated output and direction to drive the rudder and boom motors direction and speed
   On the joystick x is the rudder, y is the boom

   Uses counter 2 and interrupts to generate fast mode pwm pulses, freq is 1.960kHz
   Normal operation the diagnostic led fashes on and off every second via the ISR

   All inputs have internal pullups enabled
   so switches are 0 when pressed, and a 1 when released

   There are a number of simple diagnostics which can be enable by the #DEFINEs in Yacht.h
*/

/** Software Structure Overview
   The system consists of 8 files:
    Yacht_V1.ino:  Variable declarations, oject definitions, ISR, Setup and main loop
    Yacht_V1.h:    Diagnostic definitions, I/O and constants
    JoyStick.cpp:  Joystick class member functions
    JoyStick.h:    Joystick class decelerations
    Motor.cpp:     Motor class member functions
    Motor.h:       Motor class decelerations
    Switch.cpp:    Swtch class member functions
    Switch.h:      Switch class decelerations

    The main loop logic for the x axis is:
    check if time to flash the onboard led on or off, used to show program and isr are running and aid with setting up the reed switches
    check if time to read the joystick, then
      calls "check_X_Axis()" to check for a change in the x axis of the joystick current reading compared to the last read
      if there is a change, calls "process_X()" which returns an updated speed and direction via call by reference paramaters.
      Then with the new speed and direction,
      checks if moving towards starboard and movement to starboard is inhibited, if yes then stops the motor
      checks if moving towards port and movement to port is inhibited, if yes then stops the motor.
      Then updates the timers which track how long we have been moving forwards or reverse.
      Finally for the x axis,
      calls "rudder_Motor.set_Requested_Speed(spd)"  to set new speed
      calls "rudder_Motor.set_Requested_Dir()" to set new direction.

      Repeats for the y axis.

      Then calls:
      "rudder_Motor.update_Speed() to update rudder motor speed from the requested speed
      "rudder_Motor.update_Dir()" to update rudder motor direction from the requested direction
      "boom_Motor.update_Speed()" to update boom motor speed from the requested speed
      "boom_Motor.update_Dir()" to update boom motor direction from the requested direction

      Note the above code is only processed each time it is time to read and process the joystick. This fixed period at which it reads and processes the joystick,
      limits the system response time and provides the accelaration and de-acceleratio of the motors.

    Finally each time around the main loop, check for and process any changes to the end of travel reed switches by calling:
      "check_Rudder_Starboard_Switch()"
      "check_Rudder_Port_Switch()"
      "check_Boom_Tight_Switch()"
      "check_Boom_Loose_Switch()"
      for each of these if switch has closed and the chain is moving in that direction, set the flag to inhibit movement and stop the motor.
      If the switch is released only clear the inhibit flag if the chain has been moving away from the switch for a defined minimum period. This is to deal with overshoot.
      For example, the rudder chain could be moving towards starboard, the chain reaches the limit switch and closes the switch,
      the inhibit movement towards starboard flag is set and the motor speed is set to stopped.
      Next time around the main loop, when it is time to scan the joystick, then the motor speeds and direction are updated and the motor will begin to de-accelerate.
      As the motor de-accelerates it may overshoot and move past the limit switch before it finally stops and the limit switch will open.
      A brief request on the joystick to move to port away from the starboard limit switch, the chain will accelerate towards port and then de-accelerate and stop,
      but the chain may have not reached the limit switch yet and the switch may still be open. If the inhibit movement to starboard flag were to be cleared at this time,
      then movement back to starboard would be allowed and the chain would run off the sprocket on the rudder motor. To prevent this,
      if the inhibit movement to starboard flag is set, then the chain must move to port for a minimum period to assure that the chain has moved past the limit switch,
      before the flag is cleared.
